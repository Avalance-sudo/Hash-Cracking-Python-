# Hash-Cracking-Python-
# What is Hash Cracking 
Hash cracking is the process of discovering the original input data (often passwords) that was transformed into a hash using a cryptographic hash function.
ash functions:
- Are one-way (they can't be reversed mathematically).
- Produce fixed-length outputs regardless of input length.
- Are designed to be collision-resistant (two inputs should not produce the same hash).
- Because hashes can't be directly reversed, cracking them involves guessing inputs, hashing those guesses, and comparing them to the target hash

  # Why use Python for this Project
  We chose Python because it's a versatile, beginner-friendly language that excels at automation and scripting tasks like hash cracking. Python offers built-in libraries such as hashlib that support common hashing algorithms making it easy to generate and compare hashes. It also allows us to rapidly prototype custom attacksâ€”like dictionary or brute-force methods.Additionally, Python's readability and wide support for third-party libraries make it ideal for experimenting with various cracking strategies


# Explanation of the code 

The script is organized into a class called PasswordCracker and a main block that allows user interaction and performs the cracking operation. We will now walk through the key components and their functionality.The script begins by importing two essential libraries:hashlib: This module provides a collection of secure hash algorithms, including MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and more. It is used to generate cryptographic hash values, which are the core of this script's functionality. path from os: This module is used to handle file system paths. In the script, it is specifically utilized to check whether the wordlist file provided by the user exists, ensuring that the file is accessible before attempting to read from it.The core functionality of the script is encapsulated within the PasswordCracker class. This class manages the process of password hashing and cracking.__init__ Method is the constructor of the PasswordCracker class. It accepts a single parameter, hash_format, which specifies the cryptographic hash algorithm to use (e.g., sha256, md5, etc.). The constructor first checks whether the specified hash format is valid by comparing it to the list of algorithms guaranteed by hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed. If the format is invalid, it raises a ValueError. If the format is valid, it stores the hash format in the instance variable self.hash_format and initializes self.hashed_password to None.The hash_password method is responsible for computing the hash of a given password using the selected hash format. It first creates a new hash object using the hashlib.new(self.hash_format) function, where self.hash_format is the hashing algorithm chosen by the user. The password is encoded into bytes using password.encode(), and then this byte-encoded password is passed into the hash object with hash_object.update(). Finally, the hash value of the password is obtained using hash_object.hexdigest() and stored in self.hashed_password.The crack_password method attempts to crack the hashed password by using a wordlist. The wordlist is a text file containing common passwords or password guesses, with one password per line. The method opens the wordlist file and iterates over each word. For each word, it computes the hash using the same hash format as the target hashed password. If the hash of a word from the wordlist matches the target hashed password, the method returns that word as the cracked password. If no match is found after checking all words, the method returns None.
